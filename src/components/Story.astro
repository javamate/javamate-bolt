        <p class="text-lg text-primary-800 mb-6">
          Javamate Coffee Roasters was born from a simple passion: creating exceptionally delicious coffee while making a positive impact on the world.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Founded in 2020 by coffee enthusiasts Sarah and Michael, Javamate began as a small roastery focused on quality and sustainability. We travel the world to find the best coffee beans, build relationships with farmers, and ensure fair prices for their incredible work.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8">
          Today, our mission remains the same: to deliver freshly roasted, ethically sourced specialty coffee directly to your door, while supporting the communities who grow it.
